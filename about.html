<body>
   <p>I just graduated with my BS in Game Programming and Development.  I have always had a passion of developing websites and making the most amazing user friendly sites.  I want to take my coding skills and not only produce fun, adventurous, open world games.  My heart lies with both frontend  and backend development for the web and I hope I can utilize my knowledge of both design and development to make the internet an exciting place for everyone.</p> 

   <p>I would love to help the older generations understand what the newest generation love about mobiles and the internet.  Soon all generation will understand the need for  everything at your finger tips.  Watching older people with grandkids trying to learn what the fuss is all about with social media facinates me because they are completely from an alternate universe.  I want to make it as easy as possible with Accessibility.</p>
